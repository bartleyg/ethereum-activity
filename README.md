[Ethereum Activity](https://ethereumactivity.com) analyzes your transactions to calculate stats on the blockchain dapps you use. It reads your ethereum address from MetaMask, Trust, or a web3 compatible browser. Then your transaction history is parsed from Etherscan and interesting stats on ETH and gas use are produced in your address activity profile.
